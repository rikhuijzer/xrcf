# arnoldc

This directory contains an example compiler that can compile and run a small program in the ArnoldC language.
The example shows how to build your own language and compiler.

The ArnoldC language is based on one-liners from Arnold Schwarzenegger movies.
This is what a valid "Hello, World!" program in ArnoldC looks like:

```arnoldc
IT'S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "Hello, World!\n"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
```

Here, `IT'S SHOWTIME` means "begin main", `TALK TO THE HAND` means "print", and `YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED` means "end main".

This language allows Arnold Schwarzenegger to be a programmer.
Of course, since it's Arnold, we still want the program to run fast so we compile to LLVM.

The code to build the compiler is in the same directory as this README.
In this README, we will show how the compiler can be built and used.
First, we install it via:

```sh
$ cargo install --path arnoldc
```

This places the `arnoldc` binary in `$HOME/.cargo/bin`.
(It can be uninstalled later with `cargo uninstall arnoldc`.)

Next, let's see whether the installation was successful:

```sh
$ arnoldc --help
```

This should print:

```text
A compiler for the ArnoldC language

Usage: arnoldc [OPTIONS] [INPUT]

Arguments:
  [INPUT]  The input file (- is interpreted as stdin) [default: -]

Options:
      --convert-unstable-to-mlir  Convert unstable operations to MLIR
      --convert-func-to-llvm      Convert function operations to LLVM IR
      --convert-mlir-to-llvmir    Convert MLIR to LLVM IR
      --convert-arnold-to-mlir    Convert ArnoldC operations to MLIR
      --compile                   Compile the code
  -h, --help                      Print help
  -V, --version                   Print version
```

If this succeeds, then that shows that the compiler is correctly built.

To compile ArnoldC, let's create a file called `tmp.arnoldc` with the following content:

```arnoldc
IT'S SHOWTIME
TALK TO THE HAND "Hello, World!\n"
YOU HAVE BEEN TERMINATED
```

Before we run this, let's see what the compiler does with the `--convert-example-to-mlir` pass:

```sh
$ arnoldc --convert-arnold-to-mlir tmp.arnoldc
```

This prints:

```mlir
module {
  func.func @main() -> i32 {
    unstable.printf("Hello, World!\0A")
    %0 = arith.constant 0 : i32
    return %0 : i32
  }
}
```

What this shows is that the compiler has converted the ArnoldC code to MLIR.
It also added a 0 return value to the `main` function.
This ensures that the program will return a 0 status code, which is the convention for programs that didn't crash.

Although this MLIR code looks nice, Arnold programmers probably want to run the code.
To do so, let's convert the MLIR code to LLVM IR by running all the required passes in order:

```sh
$ arnoldc --convert-arnold-to-mlir --convert-unstable-to-mlir --convert-func-to-llvm --convert-mlir-to-llvmir tmp.arnoldc
```

This prints:

```llvm
; ModuleID = 'LLVMDialectModule'
source_filename = "LLVMDialectModule"

declare i32 @printf(ptr)
define i32 @main() {
  %3 = alloca i8, i16 15, align 1
  store [15 x i8] c"Hello, World!\0A\00", ptr %3, align 1
  %4 = call i32 @printf(ptr %3)
  ret i32 0
}


!llvm.module.flags = !{!0}

!0 = !{i32 2, !"Debug Info Version", i32 3}
```

Remembering these passes and in the order in which to run them is cumbersome, so let's use the `--compile` flag, which is a wrapper around the above command:

```sh
$ arnoldc --compile tmp.arnoldc
```

It returns the same LLVM IR as above.

To run our compiled code, we can use the LLVM interpreter via the `lli` command.
`lli` executes programs written in the LLVM bitcode format.
This executable is part of the LLVM project, so it can usually be installed via the package manager.
For example, on MacOS, `brew install llvm`.

Let's run our compiled code:

```sh
$ arnoldc --compile tmp.arnoldc | lli
```

This should print:

```text
Hello, World!
```

That wraps up this walkthrough, or as Arnold would conclude:

```text
I'LL BE BACK
```

To learn how to build your own compiler, see the files inside this `arnoldc` directory.
It is split into three parts:

1. `src/main.rs` defines the command line interface.
1. `src/arnold.rs` specifies how to parse the ArnoldC code (convert the text to data structures).
1. `src/arnold_to_mlir.rs` contains the `--convert-arnold-to-mlir` pass, which converts the ArnoldC code to MLIR.

All other passes such as `--convert-func-to-llvm` are implemented in the `xrcf` crate.
